# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Default agent context to the smaller compact JSON/GCF representation, with
  explicit format overrides and automatic report output via `--format auto`.
- Add `agent --dry-run` to inspect the exact prompt without contacting Ollama.
- Add local `gcf encode`, `gcf decode`, and `gcf stats` commands with bounded
  input and comparisons against compact JSON; reject duplicate JSON keys.

- Add optional GCF generic-profile output to `preview` and `scan-report`, and
  `agent --context-format gcf` with valid encoding under the prompt budget.
- Document Ollama and NotebookLM text compatibility and add round-trip, CLI,
  escaping, integer precision, truncation, and mock Ollama transport tests.

## v1.0.2 - 2026-09-04

- Fix release publication after the hardened checkout removes the Git remote.

## v1.0.1 - 2026-09-04

- Fix GitHub release Go-download checksum verification using Go's official download metadata.

## v1.0.0 - 2026-09-04

- Add repeatable `--exclude-folder` scanning controls and optional
  `exclude_folders` configuration while keeping generated default configuration
  behavior-only.
- Add `sync --dry-run` to verify local input and the selected backend, show the
  planned upload/deletion set, and make no remote or receipt changes.
- Add `clyde receipt status` for read-only sync receipt summaries and safe
  resume guidance, including a verified bundle resume command when available.
- Emit immediate sync phases and periodic progress heartbeats during long local
  preparation and backend operations, with status-daemon support.

- Detect Git worktrees from any supplied subdirectory and run Git-aware
  discovery from the worktree root while filtering results back to the requested
  directory.
- Fail closed when raw filesystem discovery hits clyde's path ceiling, instead
  of producing a silently truncated bundle.
- Wire `bundle --allow-filesystem-fallback` through the options-aware scanner.
- Publish bundles through a verified temporary directory swap so `--force`
  cannot leave mixed old/new bundle files behind.
- Recompute secret-scan target evidence during bundle verification.
- Reconcile planned destructive NLM deletions against current remote source IDs
  before retrying and mark already-missing planned IDs as deleted.
- Require recorded backend path, executable digest, package, and MCP
  environment identity to match before resuming a sync receipt.
- Harden release publishing by refusing existing releases, staging uploads as a
  draft, comparing remote checksums to local checksums, generating
  Sigstore-signed SLSA provenance, publishing only after verification, and
  removing the checkout token remote.
- Verify downloaded Go bootstrap archives against Go's published SHA-256 files
  before extraction.

## v0.2.8 - 2026-08-23

- Add explicit `--allow-filesystem-fallback` scan flag for the rare case where a
  Git repository should be scanned without Git-aware discovery. The default
  remains fail-closed when Git discovery fails.
- Bound raw filesystem candidate collection before sorting so non-Git traversal
  stops at clyde's path ceiling instead of collecting the whole tree.
- When a remote chunk upload succeeds but the local uploaded receipt write fails,
  attempt to persist the chunk as `ambiguous` and return an explicit
  remote-success/local-failure error.
- Record backend executable `--version` output when available and the MCP
  environment contract in sync receipts.

## v0.2.7 - 2026-08-23

- Fail closed when Git-aware repository discovery fails instead of falling back
  to raw filesystem traversal inside Git repositories.
- Record repository discovery provenance in bundle manifests, including the
  discovery method, whether Git exclusions were honored, Git commit, and
  working-tree state.
- Require `--resume` receipts to already exist so mistyped receipt paths cannot
  silently start a fresh transfer.
- Persist chunk receipt entries as `pending` before remote upload and refuse
  automatic resume of pending or ambiguous chunks.
- Require sync receipts for `--delete-existing-sources` and resume destructive
  deletion from the originally planned source ID inventory only.
- Reject symlinked parent directories for bundle and receipt writes, and reject
  symlinks or non-regular files when reading bundles and receipts.
- Reject symlinked parent directories during config initialization.
- Run external secret scanners against a private snapshot of clyde's captured
  source bytes and record target/output evidence digests.
- Record backend command, resolved executable path, executable digest when
  readable, package, and runtime identity in sync receipts.
- Pin CI/release actions and analysis tool versions, make release archive
  metadata reproducible, smoke-check every archive, and verify published asset
  checksums after release upload.
- Use Windows Job Objects for MCP subprocess cleanup when available, with
  direct child termination as a fallback.
- Stream `chunks.jsonl` decoding and digest verification during bundle loading
  to avoid retaining a second raw copy of the chunk file in memory.
- Verify reconstructed bundle file digests incrementally without constructing
  duplicate whole-file strings, and avoid copying chunk text into verification
  index maps.
- Serialize MCP request/response operations so the client remains safe if
  future callers issue concurrent requests.
- Pre-count per-file chunk totals before materializing chunk records so the
  generated chunk limit is enforced before building large intermediate chunk
  slices.
- Add regression tests for fail-closed Git discovery, destructive deletion
  resume safety, receipt resume semantics, symlink path refusal, config
  initialization path safety, secret-scan
  evidence, backend identity, and bundle discovery metadata.

## v0.2.6 - 2026-08-23

- Bind reviewed bundles to uploaded content with per-chunk digests, an overall
  bundle digest, `clyde bundle verify`, and `sync --bundle --approve-digest`.
- Write bundle artifacts and sync receipts with private atomic filesystem
  semantics, symlink refusal, and explicit `--force` overwrite behavior.
- Add durable sync receipts, returned source ID capture, resumable bundle sync,
  and pre-delete NotebookLM source inventories for `--delete-existing-sources`.
- Add optional external secret-scanner enforcement for bundles with
  `--require-secret-scan` and `--secret-scan-command`.
- Add aggregate scanner limits, UTF-8-safe chunk splitting, MCP environment
  allowlisting, bounded MCP stderr, and status daemon hardening.
- Expand CI to gofmt, tests, race tests, vet, builds, CLI smoke, fuzz smoke,
  staticcheck, and govulncheck; add tag-driven release archives, checksums,
  SBOM, and release asset verification.
- Split oversized internal domains for bundle, sync, MCP, status, receipt, and
  subprocess handling into smaller files while preserving the public CLI.
- Centralize top-level command dispatch, command metadata, and completion shell
  dispatch behind typed registries with drift tests.
- Harden scanner file reads by verifying opened-file identity and size around
  bounded reads before accepting source content.
- Harden config initialization with private atomic writes, `0700` config
  directories, and refusal to overwrite existing files or symlinks.
