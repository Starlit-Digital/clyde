# clyde Testing Guide

This document explains how to test clyde locally, what the current tests cover,
and which checks should run before a pull request, release, or feature pass.

clyde is a small Go CLI for preparing auditable repository source bundles,
syncing approved context to NotebookLM, and asking local Ollama models for
repo-aware feedback. Its tests focus on safety, predictable CLI behavior,
bounded input/output, local-first defaults, and cross-platform portability.

## Quick Start

Run the full test suite from the repository root:

```bash
go test ./...
```

For a normal code change, run:

```bash
gofmt -w $(find . -name '*.go')
go test ./...
```

For a release or feature pass, run the standard smoke set:

```bash
gofmt -w $(find . -name '*.go')
go test ./...
go run ./cmd/clyde --about
go run ./cmd/clyde help --json
go run ./cmd/clyde scan-report . --json
```

## CI Test Matrix

The GitHub Actions workflow is `.github/workflows/test.yml`. clyde's GitHub
organization uses a local-only Actions policy, so workflows must not use
external `uses:` steps. Bootstrap checkout is inline, and post-checkout logic
lives in `.github/scripts/`. The policy guard
`.github/scripts/check-github-policy.sh` rejects blocked workflow patterns and
unpinned `@latest` CI tools.

The main matrix runs:

```bash
go test ./...
go test -race ./internal/clyde
go vet ./...
go build ./cmd/clyde
```

on:

- `ubuntu-latest`
- `macos-latest`
- `windows-latest`

Linux also runs fuzz smoke tests for chunk splitting, JSON-RPC envelope parsing,
glob matching, and secret detection. A separate analysis job runs pinned
Staticcheck and govulncheck versions. These checks do not prove external tools such as Ollama,
Node/npm, NotebookLM MCP, or `nlm` are available in every environment.

Before changing GitHub workflows, read `.github/WORKFLOW_POLICY.md` and run:

```bash
.github/scripts/check-github-policy.sh
```

## Core Test Areas

### Repository Scanning

Scanner tests verify that clyde includes useful source files while skipping
unsafe or noisy material.

Covered behavior:

- likely secret files are skipped;
- caller-provided excludes are respected;
- symlinks are skipped;
- Git repositories fail closed when Git-aware discovery fails unless
  `--allow-filesystem-fallback` is explicit;
- Git worktrees are detected from requested subdirectories and repository-root
  exclusions are still honored;
- raw filesystem discovery fails closed if clyde's path ceiling is reached;
- non-directory repo paths are rejected;
- invalid file-size limits are rejected;
- include globs may match no files without crashing.

Run focused scanner tests:

```bash
go test ./internal/clyde -run 'TestScanRepo'
```

### Bundling

Bundler tests verify the local bundle written by `clyde bundle`.

Covered behavior:

- chunk headers are preserved;
- chunk splitting preserves complete text;
- invalid chunk sizes fall back safely;
- book metadata is recorded;
- `manifest.json` and `chunks.jsonl` records are written;
- output paths that are files are rejected;
- skipped files are recorded.

Run focused bundler tests:

```bash
go test ./internal/clyde -run 'TestMakeChunks|TestWriteBundle|TestSplitText'
```

### CLI Behavior

CLI tests verify user-facing commands and AI-ready command surfaces.

Covered behavior:

- `preview` text and JSON output;
- `scan-report` JSON output and invalid `--top` rejection;
- `bundle` manifest writing;
- `sync` safety checks;
- top-level help and command help;
- `help --json` command catalog;
- help does not require a valid config;
- `doctor` text/JSON behavior;
- official product links in help and about output;
- shell completion output for supported shells;
- unsupported completion shell rejection;
- invalid numeric flags;
- prompt file and stdin size limits.

Run focused CLI tests:

```bash
go test ./internal/clyde -run 'Test.*Help|Test.*Doctor|Test.*Completion|TestPreview|TestScanReport|TestBundle'
```

### Configuration

Config tests verify clyde accepts predictable configuration and rejects unsafe
or malformed values.

Covered behavior:

- config file loading;
- environment variables overriding file values;
- Ollama URL validation;
- invalid environment URL rejection;
- blank model rejection;
- string trimming;
- NUL byte rejection;
- negative limit rejection;
- writable config file rejection;
- zero-value defaults;
- `config init` and `config show`.

Run focused config tests:

```bash
go test ./internal/clyde -run 'TestLoadConfig|TestConfigCommand'
```

### Ollama And Local AI Commands

Ollama tests use local test HTTP servers. They do not require a real Ollama
daemon.

Covered behavior:

- model listing;
- metadata sanitization;
- generation request shape;
- `num_ctx` forwarding;
- hardened input rejection;
- streaming responses;
- oversized stream line rejection;
- non-2xx and malformed stream reporting;
- environment-selected model and URL;
- CLI `ask`, `agent`, and `models --json`;
- remote Ollama URLs are rejected by `agent` unless explicitly allowed.

Run focused Ollama tests:

```bash
go test ./internal/clyde -run 'TestOllama|TestCLIAsk|TestCLIModels|TestAgentRejectsRemote'
```

### NotebookLM, MCP, And JSON-RPC Boundaries

These tests protect clyde's external-process and protocol boundaries.

Covered behavior:

- command summaries redact source text payloads;
- subprocess timeout errors do not leak full text payloads;
- limited buffers truncate output;
- MCP content-length parsing is tolerant where appropriate;
- oversized MCP frames are rejected;
- JSON-RPC HTTP failures are reported;
- JSON-RPC request bodies are bounded.

Run focused protocol tests:

```bash
go test ./internal/clyde -run 'TestMCP|TestRPC|TestCommandSummary|TestRunCommand|TestLimitedBuffer'
```

### Agent Prompting

Agent tests verify that clyde builds useful bounded prompts for local models.

Covered behavior:

- task and repository context are included;
- configured default model selection;
- UTF-8-safe truncation;
- file priority ordering;
- already-prioritized chunks avoid unnecessary sorting;
- safe prefix edge cases.

Run focused agent tests:

```bash
go test ./internal/clyde -run 'TestBuildAgentPrompt|TestPrioritizeAgentChunks|TestSafePrefix'
```

## Cross-Platform Testing

clyde is intended to run on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

CI runs tests on all three operating systems. Locally, you can at least
cross-build:

```bash
for target in darwin/amd64 darwin/arm64 linux/amd64 linux/arm64 windows/amd64 windows/arm64; do
  os="${target%/*}"
  arch="${target#*/}"
  suffix=""
  if [ "$os" = windows ]; then suffix=".exe"; fi
  GOOS="$os" GOARCH="$arch" go build -o "/tmp/clyde-${os}-${arch}${suffix}" ./cmd/clyde
done
```

Cross-building proves the code compiles for a target. It does not prove all
external tools are installed or that terminal integration behaves identically on
that operating system.

Windows-specific notes:

- PowerShell completion is loaded with:

  ```powershell
  clyde completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
  ```

- Clink completion can be generated with:

  ```powershell
  clyde completion clink > "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\\clink\\clyde.lua"
  ```

- Windows users still need Git for fast repository discovery and Ollama/Node
  tools for local model or NotebookLM workflows.

## Release Verification

Before publishing a clyde release, run:

```bash
git status --short
gofmt -w $(find . -name '*.go')
go test ./...
go test -race ./internal/clyde
go vet ./...
go run ./cmd/clyde --about
go run ./cmd/clyde help --json
go run ./cmd/clyde doctor --json
go run ./cmd/clyde scan-report . --json
```

Also generate every completion target:

```bash
for shell in bash zsh fish powershell pwsh elvish nushell nu xonsh tcsh clink yash oil osh ysh; do
  go run ./cmd/clyde completion "$shell" >/tmp/clyde-completion-"$shell"
done
```

Recommended cross-build release smoke:

```bash
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o /tmp/clyde.exe ./cmd/clyde
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go test -c ./internal/clyde -o /tmp/clyde-windows-test.exe
```

The release workflow uses only local shell steps to satisfy the repository's
local-only Actions policy. It verifies the downloaded Go bootstrap archive,
builds deterministic tar/zip archives, creates an SPDX JSON SBOM with release
artifact checksums plus Go toolchain and optional NotebookLM backend metadata,
creates SLSA provenance, signs that provenance with Sigstore keyless signing in
GitHub Actions OIDC, checks every archive for required files, runs the Linux
amd64 binary smoke test, uploads assets to a draft release, compares remote
checksums to the local checksum file, and publishes only after verification.

Windows cross-build checks are useful after MCP process lifecycle changes
because the Windows implementation uses Job Objects behind build tags.

If the release changes AI, NotebookLM, Ollama, or config behavior, include a
short note in the release body explaining which focused tests covered that area.

## When To Add Tests

Add or update tests whenever behavior changes.

Use this guide:

- New command: add CLI tests for help, success behavior, invalid arguments, and
  JSON output if the command is automation-facing.
- New flag: test valid value, invalid value, and interaction with config/env
  defaults.
- New config field: test file loading, env override, validation, defaulting, and
  string hardening if applicable.
- New external process call: test timeout behavior, redacted errors, bounded
  stdout/stderr, and missing command behavior.
- New HTTP/protocol code: test non-2xx, malformed response, oversized response,
  and request shape.
- New repository scanner rule: test inclusion, exclusion, and skip reason.
- New AI prompt behavior: test prompt content, ordering, truncation, and UTF-8
  boundaries.
- New shell completion support: test generated output and unsupported shell
  rejection.

## Common Failures

`gofmt` output lists files:

- Run `gofmt -w` on those files.

`go test ./...` fails only on Windows:

- Check path separators, executable suffixes, file permissions, shell
  assumptions, and hard-coded `/tmp` paths.

Config tests fail with permission expectations:

- clyde rejects writable config files as a hardening measure. Preserve that
  unless the security model changes deliberately.

Ollama tests fail:

- They should use test servers, not a real local daemon. Check request paths,
  JSON shape, timeout values, and stream parsing.

NotebookLM subprocess tests fail:

- Check that text payloads stay redacted in errors and summaries. Avoid logging
  full source text in failure paths.

Completion tests fail:

- Update command lists and shell-specific expected snippets together.
- Keep `help --json`, human help, and completions aligned.

## Before Pushing

Minimum:

```bash
git status --short
gofmt -w $(find . -name '*.go')
go test ./...
git diff --check
```

Recommended for release or broad feature work:

```bash
go test -race ./...
go vet ./...
go run ./cmd/clyde --about
go run ./cmd/clyde help --json
go run ./cmd/clyde doctor --json
go run ./cmd/clyde scan-report . --json
```

Commit only after the relevant suite passes or the remaining failure is clearly
unrelated and documented.
